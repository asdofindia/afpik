The Constitution of India makes health in India the responsibility of the state governments, rather than the central federal government. It makes every state responsible for "raising the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties". The National Health Policy was endorsed by the Parliament of India in 1983 and updated in 2002 and again in 2017. There are great inequalities in health between states. Infant mortality in Kerala is 12 per thousand live births, but in Assam it is 56.
